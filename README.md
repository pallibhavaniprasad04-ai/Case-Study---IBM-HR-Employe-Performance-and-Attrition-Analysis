# Case-Study---IBM-HR-Employe-Performance-and-Attrition-Analysis

📘 **Project Overview**

- This project explores employee attrition patterns using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset.
- The goal is to uncover why employees leave the organization and identify actionable insights to help HR improve retention.

- Rather than focusing on machine learning, the project emphasize:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization-driven insights**

🛠️ **Tech Stack & Libraries**
- The following libraries are used in this project:
**pandas** → For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
**numpy** → For numerical operations and summary statistics
**matplotlib & seaborn** → For data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, etc.)

🧩 **Project Tasks**
## 🧹 Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Loaded dataset and inspected structure
- Removed unnecessary columns (EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours, etc.)
- Checked for duplicates and missing values
- Treated outliers in MonthlyIncome, YearsAtCompany, TotalWorkingYears

## 📊 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of Age, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction
**Bivariate Analysis**: Attrition vs JobRole, Department, OverTime, Salary
**Multivariate Analysis**: Combined influence of JobRole, Income & Satisfaction

## 📈 3️⃣ Visualization & Insight Generation
- Created countplots, boxplots, and violinplots using Seaborn
- Compared attrition patterns visually for HR decision-making

## 🔍 Key Questions
Question	Description
- 👥 What’s the average employee age?	Find workforce demographics
- 💼 Which job roles have the highest attrition?	Identify high-risk roles
- 💰 Does low income lead to higher attrition?	Analyze salary impact
- ⏱️ Does overtime increase attrition?	Check work pressure link
- 😀 Does job satisfaction reduce attrition?	Evaluate employee happiness

## Insight & Summary Observation
- OverTime Effect	Employees with **OverTime** = Yes have 4× higher attrition.
- **Salary** Factor	Low-income employees are more likely to quit.
- **Age** Group	Employees aged <30 years show highest attrition.
- **Department**	Sales and Research roles have higher turnover.
- **Job Satisfaction**	High satisfaction reduces attrition risk significantly.
  
## Business Impact:
- **HR* can reduce attrition by 10-15% by focusing on work-life balance, Fair pay, and employee engagement initiatives.
